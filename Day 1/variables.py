# The thing to note here is that when we run this, by the end of line 5,
# the value of the Variable 'name' has changed to whatever was the last value,
# in this case "Jethwani".

# What this means is that if we wrote a line of code after line 5,
# that uses the Variable name, its going to have the Value of "Jethwani" only.

# Challenge
# Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.
