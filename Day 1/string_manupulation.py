# String Concatenation
print("Hello" + "World")

# Spaces are not automatically added
print("Hello" + " " + "World")

# Another Way to do the same
print("Hello " + "World")

#Indentation is key in Python
 print("Hello " + "World")

# Note: You see we added a space or indent
# on the 3rd print statement
# while the first 3 statements are correct
# But we get an error when we try to run the
# file now.
# This is because Python is a COMPILED Language
# & NOT an INTERPRETTED Language
# Meaning the code is fully checked in it's
# Entirity before being run, and is NOT RUN
# line by line.
