# Write a program ask's your name &
# prints the number of characters in a user's name.

# username = input("What is your name? ")
# print(len(username))

# Another way to do the above in a single line:

print(len(input("What is your name? ")))

# Write a program that ask's your name and greets you, in a single line.

# print("Hello " + input("What is your name? "))

# The reason this works is that,
# The inner most () is executed first and then outwards!
