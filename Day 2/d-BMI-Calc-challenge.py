# Instructions

    # Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
    # The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. 
    # e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
    # The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
    # or BMI = Weight / Height Squared(2)

# Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.

# Example Input
    # weight = 80
    # height = 1.75

# Example Output
    # 80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
    # 26

height = float(input("enter your height in meters: "))
weight = int(input("enter your weight in kg: "))

BMI = weight / (height**2)

BMI = int(BMI)

print(BMI)
